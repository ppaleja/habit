Built based on framework provided by time-tracking app from Fullstack React Native by Devin Abbot et al.\n\nVersion a.1\n\nCurrent Functionality:\n  - You can add/remove habits\n  - Habits are defined by their name and what group they belong to\n  - You can 'track' your habit, by clicking the 'Complete' button when you have done the self-prescribed task. \n     The app will keep track of your streak of completing the habits. It will reset if you miss a day.\n\nFuture functionality:\n  - Be able to make habits only for specific days.\n  - Calendar view, to track which days you made it\n  - Unit functionality, (e.g. do 15 pushups, you can track each individual pushup)\n  - Timer functionality, (e.g. meditate for 15 minutes, will actually time you)"
