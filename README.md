 # Habit Tracker
 ## Why?
 I recently got an iPhone after years of having and Android. One thing that annoyed me about iPhone apps is that many of them cost money. Even the simplest Habit Tracking app required a subscription. So, I decided I wanted to try and make my own.
 ## What is it?
 - A simple app that allows you to add and track habits that you wish to develop.
 - Built using Expo Dev Tools
 - Built based on framework provided by time-tracking app from Fullstack React Native by Devin Abbot et al.
# Changelog
## Version a.1 
### Current Functionality: 
 - You can add/remove habits
 - Habits are defined by their name and what group they belong to 
 - You can 'track' your habit, by clicking the 'Complete' button when you have done the self-prescribed task. The app will keep track of your streak of completing the habits. It will reset if you miss a day. 
### Future functionality: 
 - Be able to make habits only for specific days. 
 - Calendar view, to track which days you made it 
 - Unit functionality, (e.g. do 15 pushups, you can track each individual pushup) 
 - Timer functionality, (e.g. meditate for 15 minutes, will actually time you)
